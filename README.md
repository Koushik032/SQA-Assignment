1. Test Plan :

Scope:

Verify core user flows and quality across both Android apps and both websites: install & launch, onboarding/login, core features (chat, symptom/report flows for app-testingservice & EchoGPT), appointment/booking flows (if any), content display, file upload, form submissions, navigation, and error handling. Also test UI, responsiveness, accessibility, security basics, and exploratory testing.

Devices & OS:

Android: Samsung Galaxy A12 — Android 11

Android: Google Pixel 6 — Android 13

Android: Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 — Android 15

Desktop Browsers: Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest), Edge (latest) on Windows 10/11

Mobile Browser (responsive): Chrome on Android (same devices)


Types of tests to run:

Functional testing — core flows, inputs/outputs, form validation.

UI/UX — layout, alignment, responsive behavior, touch targets, typography.

Stability & Performance (light) — app crashes, page load time, memory spikes (smoke checks).

Security basics — sensitive data exposure, input validation (XSS/SQL injection checks on web forms), insecure storage check for apps.

Accessibility — keyboard navigation (web), screen-reader labels, color contrast, tappable target sizes.

Exploratory testing — 30–45 minute session per app/site to look for unexpected issues.
